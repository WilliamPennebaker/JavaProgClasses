# Java Programming 1/2

This java project goes over concepts that are taught in java programming 1 and 2. (Note: these were the topics covered in the programming classes I took and helped teach. So the curriculum may not be the same for everyone else.) Created this to be a refresher or even a reference for someone starting java.

Readme will be updated later.

Comments everywhere, if something is missing that was covered in your java class please let me know and I will add it.
